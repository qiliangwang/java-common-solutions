/**
 * You want to schedule a list of jobs in d days. Jobs are dependent (i.e To work on the i-th job, you have to finish all the jobs j where 0 <= j < i).
 *
 * You have to finish at least one task every day. The difficulty of a job schedule is the sum of difficulties of each day of the d days. The difficulty of a day is the maximum difficulty of a job done in that day.
 *
 * Given an array of integers jobDifficulty and an integer d. The difficulty of the i-th job is jobDifficulty[i].
 *
 * Return the minimum difficulty of a job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs return -1.
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
 * Output: 7
 * Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, total difficulty = 6.
 * Second day you can finish the last job, total difficulty = 1.
 * The difficulty of the schedule = 6 + 1 = 7
 *
 *
 * using dp to solve the problem
 * dp[i][k] means finish i jobs in k days in this case dp[6][2] is the solution &&
 * dp[0][0] means finish 0 jobs in 0 days obviously dp[0][0] is 0
 *
 * dp[1][1] = dp[0][0] + max(0, 1]
 * dp[2][1] = dp[0][0] + max(0, 2] || dp[1][1] + max(1, 2]
 * dp[2][2] = dp[1][1] + max(1, 2]
 * dp matrix:
 *
 * 0
