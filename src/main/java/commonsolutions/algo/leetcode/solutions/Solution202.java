/**

 Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

 A happy number is a number defined by the following process:
 Starting with any positive integer,
 replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits,
 and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay),
 or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
 Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

 Example:

 Input: 19
 Output: true
 Explanation:
 1^2 + 9^2 = 82
 8^2 + 2^2 = 68
 6^2 + 8^2 = 100
 1^2 + 0^2 + 0^2 = 1
